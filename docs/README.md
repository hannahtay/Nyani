Hi there! I'm NYANI ^_^
What shall we do today?
Type 'help' to see all commands :)

// Product screenshot goes here

Nyani is here to make organising tasks much easier!

## Notes about command format

- Words in `UPPERCASE` are parameters to be given by the user.
  eg. `todo TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter which can be used as `todo do homework`.
  
- Commands are not case-sensitive.
  eg. `Todo`, `todo` and `TODO` all work the same.

## Adding normal tasks `todo`

Adds general tasks without a time-sensitive window.

Example: `todo do homework`

```
Added > [T][ ] do homework < !
```

## Adding deadlines `deadline`

Adds deadlines to your task!

// Describe the action and its outcome.

// Give examples of usage

Example: `deadline do homework /by 5pm`

// A description of the expected outcome goes here

```
Added > [D][ ] this (by: then) < !
```
